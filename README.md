## Technologies Used

## Installation & Usage

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open `digital_clock.html` in a web browser.
3. The clock will automatically update in real time.

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Real-Time Clock
â”‚â”€â”€ digital_clock.html  # Main HTML file
â”‚â”€â”€ style.css           # Styling with animations
â”‚â”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript logic for real-time updates
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md           # Documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works
1. **Updating Time**
   - The `script.js` file fetches the current time using `Date()` and updates the display every second.
2. **Animating Clock Rings**
   - The CSS and JavaScript rotate circular rings to match the seconds, minutes, and hours.
3. **Date Display**
   - The current date is displayed in a user-friendly format.
